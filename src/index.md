# Welcome!

An *Uzulang* is a member of a family of languages in the style of [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org), [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) and friends. This website aims to signpost the different uzulangs, and the communities, resources and ideas around them.

## What is an Uzulang?

Uzulangs tend to be based on the same model of representing patterns of time,
and generally feature the same or similar 'mini-notation' for describing
sequences (inspired by the polymetric expressions in the venerable Bol
Processor). They have grown out of the [live coding
community](https://toplap.org/), and so are generally used for making music,
often in an improvised or semi-improvised way (e.g., by writing code to make
music while a live audience listens). Live coding is where people write code to
make live music (or other time-based art like visuals or choreography).

## TidalCycles-style uzulangs

Usually embedded in a general purpose language, with common 'mininotation'.
*Uzu* means whirlpool in Japanese. *Strudel* and *Vortex* also mean whirlpool,
in German and English respectively. There is a vague theme here around cyclic
watery formations.

## 'New wave' uzulangs

These have a custom syntax, known as 'maxi-notation' or 'mondo-notation'
