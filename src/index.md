# UZU

An *Uzulang* is a member of a family of languages in the style of [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org), based on the same model of patterns as functions of time, and often featuring a 'mini-language' for describing sequences inspired by the polymetric expressions in the venerable Bol Processor.
