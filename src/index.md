# UZU

An *Uzulang* is a member of a family of languages in the style of [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org), based on the same model of patterns as functions of time, and often featuring a 'mini-language' for describing sequences inspired by the polymetric expressions in the venerable Bol Processor.

## All things uzu

Uzulangs based on TidalCycles or derivatives:

* [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) - [source](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal) (Haskell EDSL, GPLv3)
* [Strudel](https://strudel.cc) - [source](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel) (Javascript EDSL, AGPLv3)
* idlecycles chapters [1](https://garten.salat.dev/idlecycles/chapter1.html), [2](https://garten.salat.dev/idlecycles/chapter2.html), [3](https://garten.salat.dev/idlecycles/chapter3.html), [4](https://garten.salat.dev/idlecycles/chapter4.html), [5](https://garten.salat.dev/idlecycles/chapter5.html), [6](https://garten.salat.dev/idlecycles/chapter6.html) (and watch [froos's garden](https://garten.salat.dev/) for new chapters) (Minimal Javascript EDSL, AGPLv3)
* [Tranquility](https://github.com/XiNNiW/tranquility) - (Lua EDSL, GPLv3)
* [Vortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex) - (Python EDSL, GPLv3)

'New wave' uzulangs based maxi- or mondo-notation:

* [Zwirn](https://github.com/polymorphicengine/zwirn) - (Haskell, GPLv3)
* [Modal](https://github.com/neo451/modal)- see [announcement](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/introducing-modal-new-lua-port-of-tidal/5228) (Lua EDSL, GPLv3)
* [Godwit](https://mathr.co.uk/web/godwit.html) - based on simply-typed lambda calculus, written in Haskell (not currently accessible?)
* froos's uzunotation chapters [1](https://garten.salat.dev/uzu/uzulang1.html), [2](https://garten.salat.dev/uzu/uzulang2.html), [3](https://garten.salat.dev/uzu/uzulang3.html) (Javascript, AGPLv3)
* [Strudel's inbuilt mondonotation](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/pull/1311) based on the above (Javascript, AGPv3)

## Add your uzu!

If you make an uzulang, please submit a pull request [to this file](https://github.com/tidalcycles/uzu/blob/main/src/index.md) to add it to the above list. Please note that if your language is based on an existing one (e.g. by reading its source code and translating its ideas), then you must abide by its software license.
